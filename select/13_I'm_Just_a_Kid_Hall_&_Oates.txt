Little girl, what's your name?
Now, don't you go looking at me like that
You might see I'm ashamed, what's your name?
Just talk with me
Won't you talk to me?

Will you survive, learn to drive?
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around
Can't you tell the way I'm squeezing your hand?
I'm just a kid, don't make me feel like a man

Ooh, pretty girl
Now, it ain't too hip faking lines you ain't taking
But your lips make me say it that way
Now, there's no use you resisting
This is the Cradle Thief insisting
You better let me have it my way
Fool around with me
Come on, mess around with me

Will you survive, learn to drive?
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around
Can't you tell the way I'm squeezing your hand?
I'm just a kid, don't make me feel like a man

Oh, silly girl, I'm just playing
Now, did you think that I'd be nuts enough to try and pick you up?
Don't you know it's a game? It's all a game I've been playing
But what'd, what'd you say your name was?
Just walk with me
Now, just around the corner, baby
Maybe you could even try to talk to me

Damn you, talk to me
Damn you, talk to me

Will you survive, learn to drive?
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around
Can't you tell the way I'm squeezing your hand?

I'm just a kid, don't make me feel like a man
I'm just a kid, don't make me feel like a man (I'm not a man)
I'm just a kid, don't make me feel like a man, mmh
I'm just a kid (I'm not a man)
