I woke up it was 7
Waited till 11
just to figure out that
no one would call
I think i got a lot of friends
but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone
When your spending
everyday on your own
and here it goes
I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
having more fun than me
And maybe when the night is dead
i'll crawl into my bed
Staring at these 4 walls again
I'll try to think about the
last time
I had good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And their gonna
leave me here on my own
and here it goes
I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
having more fun than me
What the fuck
hell is wrong with me
don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me
Wide awake I'm bored and I
can't fall a sleep
cause every night is the
worst night ever
I'm just a kid I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid
I know that its not fair
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody cares
cause I'm alone and the world is
having more fun than me
tonight
I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
Cause im just a kid tonight
